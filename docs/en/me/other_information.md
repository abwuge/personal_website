# Other Information

## Online Names / Usernames

### AAA太阳能维修 (The Sun Can Be Repaired)

> The sun can be repaired, the moon can be replaced, the stars that don't twinkle can be returned or exchanged!

My goodness, why would anyone parse this sentence incorrectly? I'm really not a solar panel repair technician! (In Chinese, "太阳能维修", "太阳能" can be interpreted as "solar panel" or "the sun can ...".)

### A昵称能按空格吗 (Can nicknames be spaces)

This stems from my complaint about "nicknames cannot be blank spaces."

### abwuge

> "ab" is to put the name at the front of lists, "wuge" is the pinyin for "Wu Ge" (where "Ge" is an honorific term meaning "big brother" or "boss").

This name was casually chosen a long time ago, and I've been using it ever since.

This name has some variants:

- abcdwuge
- awgplus

### whx / hxwu / Hanxun Wu

> Past the age of enjoying being called "Ge" (big brother/boss).

For newly registered accounts or usernames, I generally use my name's English abbreviation or full English name.
