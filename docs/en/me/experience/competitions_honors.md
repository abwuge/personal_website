# Competitions and Honors

## Excellent Graduate (Southwest Jiaotong University)

> -   Academic Year 2024 - 2025

I didn't expect to be able to apply for Excellent Graduate, considering my GPA isn't that high.

## National Encouragement Scholarship

> -   Academic Year 2023 - 2024

I applied for the Encouragement Scholarship for three years, <span title="This year, in order to get postgraduate recommendation, I attended classes more seriously">and finally succeeded in my last year</span>.

## Lanqiao Cup National Software and Information Technology Professional Talent Competition (Software Category)

> > Algorithm competition using OI (Olympiad in Informatics) format.
>
> -   Honorable Mention (15th Edition, Undergraduate Group A National Finals)
> -   First Prize (15th Edition, Undergraduate Group A Provincial Competition)

Lanqiao Cup! <span title="Category A competition national first prize adds 5 points for postgraduate recommendation, so I could participate in the recommendation program">It was my stubborn attempt to get postgraduate recommendation.</span>

Unfortunately, after the provincial competition, I felt I couldn't qualify for the national finals, so I didn't prepare sufficiently for the national competition.

No more words, here are the certificates:

## Chinese Undergraduate Physics Tournament

> > National undergraduate physics academic competition using IYPT (International Young Physicists' Tournament) format and some of its problems.
>
> -   Third Prize (14th Edition)

Since this is an academic competition, and participating in it indeed improved my academic research ability, I have placed the competition content in [Research Experience](research_experience.md).

This edition was hosted by Southwest Jiaotong University, so our school had two guaranteed spots for the national finals, and I successfully advanced to the national competition.

## Southwest Undergraduate Physics Tournament

> > Regional competition of the Chinese Undergraduate Physics Tournament in Southwest China.
>
> -   First Prize (7th Edition)
> -   Second Prize (6th Edition, as team leader)

### 7th Edition

This edition was held at Chongqing Normal University, which was also like a trip to Chongqing.

To be honest, due to the experience from the previous edition, I wasn't very enthusiastic about participating in this competition. But who told me Xi was competing?

### 6th Edition

This edition was held online due to the pandemic, which was unfortunate as we couldn't attend in person.

In order to get closer to Xi, during this edition, besides my own topic, I also participated quite a bit in her experiments.

Getting back to the point, I believe there was a translation issue with Problem 17 "Invisibility" (the teacher also encouraged checking the original English text rather than unofficial Chinese translations):

The term "Lenticular lenses" was translated as "双凸透镜" (biconvex lens), but after extensive research, I believed it should be translated as "光栅" (lenticular grating). Therefore, I designed my experiment based on the concept of lenticular gratings. However, my instructor insisted that the experiment should be based on biconvex lens, despite my extensive arguments for the validity of the lenticular grating interpretation. Ultimately, I was not selected as a competing participant but served as the team leader.

This would have been acceptable, but during the actual competition, the opposing team questioned whether "Lenticular lenses" should be translated as "lenticular gratings," and our team member used my very experiment that had been rejected by our instructor as evidence. **Absurd**!

### Postscript

Although my motivation for participating in both editions was not pure, the tournament greatly improved my abilities. I'm very glad I participated in these two competitions.

## Excellent Student Cadre

> -   Academic Year 2023 - 2024
> -   Academic Year 2022 - 2023
> -   Academic Year 2021 - 2022

I have always served as the class committee member in charge of organization, and because my grades are decent, applying for Excellent Student Cadre is not too difficult.

## National University Students Electrical Math Modeling Competition

> > Competition in electrical engineering and mathematical modeling for undergraduate students, organized by China Society for Electrical Engineering.
>
> > Mathematical modeling: Solving practical problems by establishing mathematical models and using mathematical methods and computer technology.
>
> -   Third Prize (16th Edition)
> -   Third Prize (14th Edition)

I participated in the Electrical Engineering Cup twice because this competition is free (laughs).

### 16th Edition

I participated in this edition during my junior year, during which my grandfather passed away, and I spent some time attending the funeral.

I worked on Problem A: [园区微电网风光储协调优化配置](../../../assets/me/experience/competitions_honors/EMCM_16_A.pdf) (Coordinated Optimal Configuration of Wind-Solar-Storage in Park Microgrid).

Competition paper:

<div id="degree-certificate-container-zh" 
     data-pdf-loader
     data-pdf-src="../../../../assets/me/experience/competitions_honors/EMCM_16_002093A.pdf"
     data-language="en"
     data-prompt-text="The PDF file is large and totally in Chinese, click to preview the paper: " 
     data-preview-button-text="Preview Paper">
</div>

The supporting materials for the paper are [here](../../../assets/me/experience/competitions_honors/EMCM_16_002093A_supporting_material.zip). I didn't have the habit of creating Git repositories and using English in comments at that time, so I can only provide a compressed file, and it may not be easy to understand for non-Chinese speakers.

Due to my grandfather's funeral and participating almost individually, this competition left me mentally exhausted and I once suffered from mathematical modeling PTSD (Just kidding).

Fortunately, I won third prize:

康 (Kang) is a sophomore from Class of 2022, <span title="Then I wasn't satisfied and deleted everything to rewrite it. So this competition wasn't 'almost' individual participation, it was 100% individual participation (exhausting)">she helped me write the problem restatement section of the paper</span>; I don't know 余 (Yu), but because I had him pay the participation fee for the May Day Cup and I didn't win, I put his name on this time.

### 14th Edition

I participated in this edition during my freshman year, working on Problem B: [5G 网络环境下应急物资配送问题](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/593610981) (Emergency Material Distribution in 5G Network Environment).

I can't find the paper anymore, so here's the certificate:

冯 (Feng) is my roommate, and we completed the modeling, algorithm, and writing work together. Since I didn't get his permission, I only kept his surname on the certificate.

## Southwest Jiaotong University CTF Rookie Cup

> > CTF (Capture The Flag) competition for freshmen at Southwest Jiaotong University.
>
> > Capture The Flag: Competition where participants find and exploit system vulnerabilities to obtain "flags" in the system and submit flags to score points.
>
> -   Third Prize (3rd Edition)

When I entered university as a freshman, I joined the Network Security Association and participated in this competition.

<span title="Actually, I still don't understand much now (July 2025)">At that time, my understanding of network security was not deep</span>, and I only solved one problem in the entire competition.

I only remember it was a problem about SQL injection.
