# Social Work

## China-U.S. Young Maker Competition

> -   Volunteer (2025, Chengdu Division)

I had heard about the China-U.S. Young Maker Competition for a long time.

Originally, I wanted to participate this year, but on second thought, I didn't have any good creative ideas at the moment, so I gave up.

Unexpectedly, I had the opportunity to participate as a volunteer.

My job was as a review assistant, so I had the privilege of sitting in on many presentations.

Impressions:

-   All the ideas were great, but why didn't they do much market research?
-   "I Love Inventions" (University Student Edition)

    > "I Love Inventions" (《我爱发明》) is a Chinese TV show featuring everyday inventors.

This was also what the judges often asked: How much does it cost? How many people would use it? How practical is it?

<span title="Why the usual routine? Because I'm writing in reverse chronological order ~">Same as always</span>, here's a certificate:

## World Science Fiction Convention

> -   Volunteer (81st Edition)

Well, well, well, this is my most low-key volunteer experience.

As a backup, I also got a certificate:

## Student Union (School of Physical Science and Technology)

> -   Department Head (Academic Year 2022 - 2023, Office Department)
> -   Staff Member (Academic Year 2021 - 2022, Office Department)

During my time as a member, I did quite a few things:

-   Evening self-study attendance: During freshman year, we had evening self-study sessions. Sometimes, we needed to count the number of people attending evening self-study.
-   Writing press releases: We were responsible for some of the school website news, but more should be handled by the news center.
-   Organizing meeting minutes: Mainly for the student union's weekly meetings.
-   Study room management: Study rooms were set up in the dormitories, and we needed to find volunteers to help manage the cleanliness of the study rooms.
-   Organizing second classroom activities: Second classroom activities hosted by the School of Physics were almost all organized by us.

As department head, I was mainly responsible for organizing second classroom activities.

I don't know what to put here, so here's an appointment letter:

## Practice Team "Embrace the 20th CPC National Congress, Stay True to the Party, and Stride Forward into a New Era" from School of Physics Student Union to Yingxiu Town, Wenchuan County, Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province

> -   Team Member (July 2022)

This was a "College Students' Summer Rural Service Program" practice activity during my tenure as department head of the School of Physics Student Union.

Here's a group photo of the practice team:

I looked really young back then.

The school website also reported on it: [物理学院"三下乡"暑期实践队赴映秀镇实地走访深入调研](https://phys.swjtu.edu.cn/info/1046/9238.htm)(School of Physics "College Students' Summer Rural Service Program" Summer Practice Team Visits Yingxiu Town for Field Investigation and In-depth Research)

## Physics Class 2021 - 05

> -   Class Committee Member in charge of organization (Academic Year 2024 - 2025)
> -   Class Committee Member in charge of organization (Academic Year 2023 - 2024)
> -   Class Committee Member in charge of organization (Academic Year 2022 - 2023)
> -   Class Committee Member in charge of organization (Academic Year 2021 - 2022)

I never thought I could serve as a class committee member for 4 consecutive years.

I do have a certificate of appointment, but it's on A4 paper with the school seal, which doesn't look good, so I don't want to put it here.
