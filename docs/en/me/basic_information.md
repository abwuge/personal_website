# Basic Information

## Name: Hanxun Wu (吴函迅)

My grandfather is knowledgeable in Chinese astrology and fortune-telling (八字命理). According to my mother's recollection, when my grandfather was choosing a name for me, he initially proposed names like "Wu Wenyu" (吴汶彧) and "Zhu Hongtao" (朱红滔, taking my mother's surname Zhu), but my mother wasn't satisfied with these options. She then asked my grandfather to provide stroke count recommendations based on my birth chart (八字).

Based on the stroke count, my mother searched through the entire "Xinhua Dictionary" (新华字典, the most authoritative Chinese dictionary) and finally selected the characters "Han" (函) and "Xun" (迅). "Han" means "cultivation" or "refinement," expressing the hope that I would become a person with depth and inner cultivation; "Xun" signifies swift action and avoiding procrastination.

I really like the name "Wu Hanxun". According to my research, among China's 1.4 billion people, "Wu Hanxun" might be a name unique to me alone.

## Childhood Name: Taotao (滔滔)

This also stems from my grandfather's fortune-telling based on Chinese astrology. My grandfather said I was lacking water element in my destiny (this is also the origin of the "Wen" character in "Wu Wenyu" and the "Tao" character in "Zhu Hongtao"), so my mother gave me the childhood name "Taotao" (also retaining the "Tao" character from "Zhu Hongtao"), meaning flowing like endless rivers.

I once jokingly asked, why not name me "Miaomiao" (淼淼)? That would be even more water (水)!

## Gender: Male

Gender is predetermined and not a matter of choice.

## Date of Birth: April 19, 2003

I think I was born around 3:58 PM. My mother gave birth to me at home, which I deeply admire her for.

My mother said that when I was born, my weight was "one scale zero and half jin" (一称零半斤, a traditional Chinese weight measurement), which in metric terms is 5.25 kilograms. Giving birth to me was particularly difficult for her.

## Place of Origin (China): Yanjiang District, Ziyang City, Sichuan Province

My family is from rural areas. My father, mother, paternal grandparents, and maternal grandparents are all farmers. Tracing back further, it's mostly the same - perhaps we've been farming for generations. After all, our family doesn't have any particular heirlooms.

## Educational Background

### Xiaoyuan Town Central Primary School, Yanjiang District, Ziyang City, Sichuan Province

In elementary school, my grades were not outstanding. The small-town school mainly taught Chinese language and mathematics, lacking arts and physical education courses. My math was decent, Chinese was average. When first introduced to English in higher grades, I performed terribly - I could only remember that the first letter of a sentence should be capitalized, and that was about it.

### Xiaoyuan Middle School, Yanjiang District, Ziyang City, Sichuan Province

Xiaoyuan Middle School was the only junior high school in town.

Entering junior high, I began studying physics, chemistry, biology, and other subjects, and my grades gradually improved.

In my third year of junior high, I took the entrance exam for Ziyang High School and successfully entered the second-tier rocket class (火箭班, elite classes in Chinese schools). In the entrance exam for Mianyang High School Ziyang Yucai School, I was fortunate to receive one of only two full scholarships among all candidates.

Initially, I chose Yucai School, but after much persuasion from various parties, I eventually transferred my student registration back to Ziyang High School.

### Ziyang High School, Sichuan Province

Ziyang High School is the best high school in Ziyang.

In high school, I naturally chose the science track - the memorization required for liberal arts was overwhelming.

After getting rid of the subjects of politics, history, and geography (my weak subjects), my grades successfully ranked at the top of my class.

During high school, I read many science fiction novels, mostly "hard" science fiction, which sparked my strong interest in physics.

### Southwest Jiaotong University

I'm not a fan of traditional classroom learning and basically rely on cramming before final exams. Fortunately, with the teachers' care, I never failed any courses during university.

However, I'm passionate about self-learning and practice. Through self-study, I've mastered multiple programming languages and have the ability to independently develop software scripts as well as design and solder circuits.

I usually post some life updates on QQ Space (QQ's social media platform), and everyone can see my updates from the past six months.

### WeChat: abwuge

WeChat is gradually replacing QQ as my main social media tool. But I still don't like posting on Moments (WeChat's social feed).

### Email: abwuge@163.com

My email response speed is usually slower than the above two instant messaging tools.

My goodness, why would anyone parse this sentence incorrectly? I'm really not a solar panel repair technician! (In Chinese, "太阳能维修", "太阳能" can be interpreted as "solar panel" or "the sun can ...".)

#### A昵称能按空格吗 (Can nicknames be spaces)

This stems from my complaint about "nicknames cannot be blank spaces."

> "ab" is to put the name at the front of lists, "wuge" is the pinyin for "Wu Ge" (where "Ge" is an honorific term meaning "big brother" or "boss").

This name has some variants:
