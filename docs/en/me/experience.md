## Research Experience

### December 2024 - June 2025: Study on Nonlinear Reconstruction of Particle Velocity for AMS Time-of-Flight Detector

> Undergraduate thesis project.

### July 2024: Particle Propagation and Detection Simulation

> Shandong Institute for Advanced Technology Summer Camp.

### May 2024 - Present: Intelligent Warehouse Game Design Based on Minecraft Platform

> SRTP (Student Research Training Program) project, National level.

### May 2023 - May 2024: Cosmic Ray Direction Reconstruction Based on Cherenkov Telescope

> SRTP (Student Research Training Program) project, Provincial level.

### July 2022 - August 2023: CUPT 2023

> CUPT (Chinese Undergraduate Physics Tournament), using some problems from IYPT (International Young Physicists' Tournament).

#### Euler's Pendulum

> Take a thick plate of non-magnetic material and fix a neodymium magnet on top of it. Suspend a magnetic rod (which can be assembled from cylindrical neodymium magnets) underneath it. Deflect the rod so that it touches the plate only with highest edge and release it. Study the motion of such a pendulum under various conditions.

#### Ball on Ferrite Rod

> A ferrite rod is placed at the bottom end of a vertical tube. Apply an ac voltage, of a frequency of the same order as the natural frequency of the rod, to a fine wire coil wrapped around its lower end. When a ball is placed on top of the rod, it will start to bounce. Explain and investigate this phenomenon.

#### Pancake Rotation

> Place a few balls in a round container. If you move the container around a vertical axis, the balls can move co-directionally with the movement of the container, or they can move in the opposite direction. Explain this phenomenon and investigate how the direction of movement depends on relevant parameters.

### May 2022 - May 2023: Research on Properties of Water Under Magnetic Field

> SRTP (Student Research Training Program) project, University level.

> Derived from IYPT 2022 problem: Strange Motion.

### December 2021 - June 2022: CUPT 2022

#### Unsinkable Disk

> A metal disk with a hole at its centre sinks in a container filled with water. When a vertical water jet hits the centre of the disc, it may float on the water surface. Explain this phenomenon and investigate the relevant parameters.

#### Three-Sided Dice

> To land a coin on its side is often associated with the idea of a rare occurrence. What should be the physical and geometrical characteristics of a cylindrical dice so that it has the same probability to land on its side and one of its faces?

#### Strange Motion

> Sprinkle small floating particles on the surface of water in a bowl. Bring a strong magnet above and near to the water surface. Explain any observed motion of the particles.

#### Invisibility

> Lenticular lenses can be used to distort light and make objects disappear. Investigate how changing the properties of the lens and the geometry of the object affect the extent to which the object can be detected.
