# Basic Information

## Name: Hanxun Wu (吴函迅)

My grandfather is knowledgeable in Chinese astrology and fortune-telling (八字命理). According to my mother's recollection, when my grandfather was choosing a name for me, he initially proposed names like "Wu Wenyu" (吴汶彧) and "Zhu Hongtao" (朱红滔, taking my mother's surname Zhu), but my mother wasn't satisfied with these options. She then asked my grandfather to provide stroke count recommendations based on my birth chart (八字).

Based on the stroke count, my mother searched through the entire "Xinhua Dictionary" (新华字典, the most authoritative Chinese dictionary) and finally selected the characters "Han" (函) and "Xun" (迅). "Han" means "cultivation" or "refinement," expressing the hope that I would become a person with depth and inner cultivation; "Xun" signifies swift action and avoiding procrastination.

I really like the name "Wu Hanxun". According to my research, among China's 1.4 billion people, "Wu Hanxun" might be a name unique to me alone.

## Childhood Name: Taotao (滔滔)

This also stems from my grandfather's fortune-telling based on Chinese astrology. My grandfather said I was lacking water element in my destiny (this is also the origin of the "Wen" character in "Wu Wenyu" and the "Tao" character in "Zhu Hongtao"), so my mother gave me the childhood name "Taotao" (also retaining the "Tao" character from "Zhu Hongtao"), meaning flowing like endless rivers.

I once jokingly asked, why not name me "Miaomiao" (淼淼)? That would be even more water (水)!

## Gender: Male

Gender is predetermined and not a matter of choice.

## Date of Birth: April 19, 2003

I think I was born around 3:58 PM. My mother gave birth to me at home, which I deeply admire her for.

My mother said that when I was born, my weight was "one scale zero and half jin" (一称零半斤, a traditional Chinese weight measurement), which in metric terms is 5.25 kilograms. Giving birth to me was particularly difficult for her.

## Place of Origin (China): Yanjiang District, Ziyang City, Sichuan Province

My family is from rural areas. My father, mother, paternal grandparents, and maternal grandparents are all farmers. Tracing back further, it's mostly the same - perhaps we've been farming for generations. After all, our family doesn't have any particular heirlooms.
