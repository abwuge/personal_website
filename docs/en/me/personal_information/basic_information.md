# Basic Information

## Name: Hanxun Wu (吴函迅)

My grandfather is knowledgeable in Chinese astrology and fortune-telling. According to my mother's recollection, when my grandfather was choosing a name for me, he initially proposed names like "Wenyu Wu" (吴汶彧) and "Hongtao Zhu" (朱红滔, taking my mother's surname Zhu), but my mother wasn't satisfied with these options. She then asked my grandfather to provide character stroke recommendations based on my birth details.

Based on the stroke count, my mother searched through the entire "Xinhua Dictionary" (the most authoritative Chinese dictionary) and finally selected the characters "函" (Han) and "迅" (Xun). "函" means "cultivation" or "refinement" (Technically, it should be "涵", but hey, they sound the same!), expressing the hope that I would become a person with depth and inner cultivation; "迅" signifies swift action and avoiding procrastination.

I really like the name "Hanxun Wu". According to my research, among China's 1.4 billion people, "Hanxun Wu" might be a name unique to me alone.

## Childhood Name: Taotao (滔滔)

This also stems from my grandfather's fortune-telling based on Chinese astrology. My grandfather said I was lacking water element in my destiny (this is also the origin of the "汶" character in "吴汶彧" and the "滔" character in "朱红滔", "氵" means water in Chinese characters), so my mother gave me the childhood name "Taotao" (also retaining the "滔" character from "朱红滔"), meaning flowing like endless rivers.

I once jokingly asked, why not name me "淼淼" (Miaomiao)? That would be even more water ("水" also means water)!

## Gender: Male

Gender is predetermined and not a matter of choice.

## Date of Birth: April 19, 2003

I think I was born around 3:58 PM. My mother gave birth to me at home, which I deeply admire her for.

My mother said that when I was born, my weight was “one scale plus half a jin” — a traditional Chinese unit of measurement — which amounts to approximately 5.25 kilograms. Giving birth to me was particularly difficult for her.

## Place of Origin (China): Yanjiang District, Ziyang City, Sichuan Province

My family is from rural areas. My father, mother, paternal grandparents, and maternal grandparents are all farmers. Tracing back further, it's mostly the same - perhaps we've been farming for generations. After all, our family doesn't have any particular heirlooms.
