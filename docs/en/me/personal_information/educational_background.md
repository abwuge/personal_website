# Educational Background

## Xiaoyuan Town Central Primary School, Yanjiang District, Ziyang City, Sichuan Province

In elementary school, my grades were not outstanding. The small-town school mainly taught Chinese language and mathematics, lacking arts and physical education courses. My math was decent, Chinese was average. When first introduced to English in higher grades, I performed terribly - I could only remember that the first letter of a sentence should be capitalized, and that was about it.

## Xiaoyuan Middle School, Yanjiang District, Ziyang City, Sichuan Province

Xiaoyuan Middle School was the only junior high school in town.

Entering junior high, I began studying physics, chemistry, biology, and other subjects, and my grades gradually improved.

In my third year of junior high, I took the entrance exam for Ziyang High School and successfully entered the second-tier rocket class (火箭班, elite classes in Chinese schools). In the entrance exam for Mianyang High School Ziyang Yucai School, I was fortunate to receive one of only two full scholarships among all candidates.

Initially, I chose Yucai School, but after much persuasion from various parties, I eventually transferred my student registration back to Ziyang High School.

## Ziyang High School, Sichuan Province

Ziyang High School is the best high school in Ziyang.

In high school, I naturally chose the science track - the memorization required for liberal arts was overwhelming.

After getting rid of the subjects of politics, history, and geography (my weak subjects), my grades successfully ranked at the top of my class.

During high school, I read many science fiction novels, mostly "hard" science fiction, which sparked my strong interest in physics.

## Southwest Jiaotong University

I'm not a fan of traditional classroom learning and basically rely on cramming before final exams. Fortunately, with the teachers' care, I never failed any courses during university.

However, I'm passionate about self-learning and practice. Through self-study, I've mastered multiple programming languages and have the ability to independently develop software scripts as well as design and solder circuits.
